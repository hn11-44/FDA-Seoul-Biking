# FDA-Seoul-Biking


Functional data analysis (FDA) is a statistical framework that enables us to convert discretely measured count of bike rented and weather conditions for the city of Seoul into functional curves in a manner that breaks away from the conventional multivariate statistic analysis. In this paper we cover the foundational concept of smoothing, smoothing with a roughness penalization, derivatives of our functional curves, and automatic data registration with phase variation through the time warping method and functional principal component analysis. After pre-processing our functional curves we conduct functional regression on our aligned and unaligned curves to compare the results. Results from scalar on function regression indicate that the unaligned model without contstant performs better than the rest in terms of the $\text{R}^2$, RMSE with a  significant F-ratio. Moreover, we have conducted FANOVA by taking the different seasons that occur in a year. We have evaluated the confidence interval of the regression estimates and determined the pointwise F-test to deterimine that our observed statistic is significant for all of the hours of the day. Our last analysis consisted of a pointwise t-test between two seasons, namely Winter and Summer. Results of observed statistic is above our critical value deeming the difference statistcially significant for all of the hours of the day.
